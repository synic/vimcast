VimCast Screencast Script
=========================

Introduction
------------

The goal of this video is not to teach anyone how to use VIM, but rather,
demonstrate to programmers why VIM might be a better choice than some of your
other plaintext programming editors, and even IDEs.

Most programmers have heard of VIM.  They've probably even heard the phrase
"best programming editor evar" in one fo the usual editor flamewars.  A good
portion of these programmers might even download VIM and give it a try.

The issue at this point is that, VIM is so different and foreign compared to
other editors, that it's hard to get passed even the splash screen, and even
then, the benefits to the editor aren't glaringly obvious.  In fact, the
interface is so unintuitive that it seems very primitive and old.  You may
wonder to yourself, WHY would I want to use some old ass command line editor
that doesn't even have a proper gui, when I can just use pretty sublime or
Eclipse or something.

I completely admit, the default interface of VIM is pretty scary.  It turns a
lot of people away, and that's without the fact that the learning curve can be
somewhat high.  At initial glance, you may be wondering where even basic items
that you take for granted in other editors are, like tabs, or search and
replace, or even an "open file" dialog.

I can tell you at this juncture, there's no reason to get discouraged.  VIM
DOES indeed support 99% of the features you want, either out of the box or
with some configuring.

But, that still doesn't answer why you'd want to use this old ass CLI editor
when there are newer, prettier, more user friendly options available.

The reason is this:  VIM is an outside the box editor.  The way you use it is
completely different from other editors.  The result is a workflow that ends
up being much faster, easier, and much more efficient.

VIM is designed to be used ENTIRELY from the keyboard, and most functions can
even be accessed without leaving your home row.  Basically anything you need to
do while coding can be done by using your keyboard.  This doesn't mean VIM
doesn't support the mouse, because it does, it's often just faster to do it
via the keyboard.  If your hands aren't leaving your keyboard every 5 seconds
to move your mouse, you are going to be faster.
